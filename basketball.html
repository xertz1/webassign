<h1 class="text"><strong>Basketball</strong></h1>
<p>Basketball is one of the most popular sports in North America. It was invented by a Canadian physical education teacher in 1891. Basketball was conceived as a safe sport compared to the more physical sports like football. Basketball is also one of the cheaper sports to play as players don't need the expensive equipment that is required for many other sports.</p>

<h2 class="text">London Lightning</h2>
<p>The NBLC (National Basketball League of Canada) is a small league with just 4 teams, all of which are in Ontario and 3 of which are in Southern Ontario. The local team, London Lightning, is based here in London and play at the Budweiser Gardens - the same arena in which the Knights hockey team plays.</p>
<p>The Lightning have won the NBLC championship both in 2022 and 2023 and now have 6 championships in total!</p>

<h2 class="text">Toronto Raptors</h2>
<p>The Toronto Raptors are the only Canadian basketball teams in the NBA (National Basketball Association) and they play in Scotiabank Arena - the same arena in which the Maple Leafs hockey team plays. Also similar to the Leafs, the Raptors struggled in the playoffs even in years when they did very well during the regular season. They were eliminated in first or second round on several occasions in recent years.</p>
<p><img title="Raptors 2019 Champions" src="images/torontoraptors.jpg" alt="Toronto Raptors 2019 Champions" /></p>
<p>However, in 2019, things were different for the Raptors. They progressed through the different series all the way to the final round, which was against the extremely talented Golden State Warriors. Although they were up against a challenging team with experience winning such championships, the Raptors managed to win that series to achieve their first ever championship. Kyle Lowry and Kawhi Leonard were arguably the two most important players on the team that year that led them to the championship. Unfortunately, Leonard left the team soon after and they have gone into rebuilding mode.</p>
