<h1 class="text"><a id="tothetop"></a>Baseball</h1>
<p>Baseball is another popular sport in North America. Although baseball is considered one of the most popular sports even in Canada, there are very few professional players who come from Canada. The vast majority come from the US and Central and South America. However, Canada does have many minor leagues with local players.</p>

<p>The Blue Jays have made it to the World Series championships twice and won both times. They were in consecutive years in 1992 and 1993. Since then, the Blue Jays haven't had much success in the post-season, usually not making it at all or getting eliminated early in the playoffs, much like their hockey counterpart, the Leafs.</p>
<p>Some of the best and most well-known players, past and present, on the Blue Jays include:</p>

<p><strong><a id="rogers"></a>Roger Clemens </strong>- Roger was a well-respected baseball pitcher who played most of his career on American teams but also played in Toronto for two years. He put up impressive records and stats and won awards for his incredible pitching. After those two years, he asked to be traded away to a team that would be more successful in winning a championship, and he was: to the Yankees where he then won two consecutive championships.</p>

<p><strong><a id="jose"></a>Jose Bautista </strong>- Jose played on many different teams in the MLB, but spent the majority of his time on the Blue Jays, from 2008 to 2017. A memorable but controversial moment came in a 2015 post-season game in which Jose hit a big homerun which would win the game, and he threw his bat in the air while watching the home run. This act, which has been called the "bat flip", was appreciated by Jays fans but caused anger to the opposing team, the Texas Rangers.</p>
